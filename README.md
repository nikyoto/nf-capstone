# ðŸ¦‰ Hoo!? - Who would rather?

> Hoo!? is a multiplayer party app which you can play with your friends to find out who would rather do a random exciting task.

## Description

**This is a capstone project for [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de/) web development bootcamp.**

Hoo!? is a multiplayer party app which you can play with your friends to find out
who would rather do a random exciting task.
I used a huge variety of tools which you can find down below.

The majority had to be done with PubNub which let me connect multiple devices together.
I needed that in case to create a lobby for multiple players.

However it's not done completely, as it still has some errors when trying to
connect all players to the question page. I'll update the README, once it's done!
